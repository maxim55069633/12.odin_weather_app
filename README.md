In this project, I create a weather forecast app. 

I learn:
1. Use "promise", "then", "catch" to write asynchronous code and handle errors.
2. Use the OpenWeather API to fetch related details.
3. Add a loading component from [website](https://loading.io/) when asynchronous code hasn't been complete.
